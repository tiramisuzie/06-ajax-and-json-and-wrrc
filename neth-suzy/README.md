# LAB 06 (AJAX requests)

**Author**: Suzy Su and Neth Horn
**Version**: 1.1.0 

## Overview
This is a blog platform that makes an AJAX call to retrieve blog data and uses Handlebars.js and jQuery to format that data and append it to the page.

## Getting Started
Run this by running live-server from this directory.

## Architecture
This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It also uses the following libraries: Handlebars.js for creating the blog entry template, jQuery to make appending blog entries to the page easier. The CSS is written using SMACSS format for some reason.

## Change Log
09-11-2018 11:26am - Application successfully retrieves blog data from AJAX call and appends to page. Blog data is saved to localstorage for easier retrieval.

09-11-2018 12:02 - Application now makes an AJAX head request to look for changes to the blog data and update the data when changes are detected.
